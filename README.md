# My Quest in Algorithms ðŸ§©

## Introduction 
Hello there! Welcome to my journey through the world of solving algorithms! This repository documents my quest to become proficiente at solving programming problems. I want to share the knowledge I acquire with everyone!

## Main Objectives ðŸš€

 1. **Self Improvement:** To enhance my understanding and skills in solving algorithmic problems.


 2. **Knowledge Sharing:** To share my learning experience with others

## Approach ðŸ”¬

Solving problems is a helpful way to become a better programmer. Algorithms sharpens logical thinking abilities!

- **Starting from Basics:** I'll begin with fundamental problems to build a strong foundation.

- **Gradual Progression:** As I gain confidence and skills, I will tackle progressively more complex problems.

- **Explanation:** Each problem, except for the most basic ones, will be accompanied by an explanation of the problem statement and my thought process behind the solution.

### For finding problems I'm going to use 2 websites:

- **LeetCode:** A popular platform for practicing coding challenges.
- **Beecrowd:** Another well-known platform for coding challenges. For the most basic ones
